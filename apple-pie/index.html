      <h1>Apple Pies</h1>
      
      <p> This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. 
      I have never seen another one quite like it. It will
      always be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local
      competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well! Ingredients
      1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie 1/2 cup unsalted butter 3
      tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/4 cup water 3 tablespoons all-purpose
      flour 1/4 cup water 1/2 cup white sugar 1/2 cup packed brown sugar 8
      Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced Directions Preheat oven to
      425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
      flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
      to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer. Place the bottom crust in
      your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work
      crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly
      so that it does not run off. Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce
      the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35
      to 45 minutes, until apples are soft. </p>
